      "text": "```json\n[\n\"Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter\",\n\"They have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment\",\n\"Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other\",\n\"This indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants\",\n\"Many species produce metabolites that are major sources of pharmacologically active drugs\",\n\"Particularly important are the antibiotics\",\n\"The response protects U. maydis from the host defense\",\n\"The system is necessary for the pathogen's virulence\",\n\"The majority of saprotrophic organisms require temperatures between 1 and 35 °C\",\n\"The majority of nutrients taken in by such organisms must be able to provide carbon, proteins, vitamins and, in some cases, ions\",\n\"The start of the modern age of mycology begins with Pier Antonio Micheli's 1737 publication of Nova plantarum genera\",\n\"He originated the still current genus names Polyporus and Tuber\",\n\"Many other mushroom species are harvested from the wild\",\n\"Certain types of cheeses require inoculation of milk curds with fungal species\",\n\"Decomposers are organisms that break down dead organisms\",\n\"Decomposition relies on chemical processes similar to digestion in animals\",\n\"The term “digestion,” however, is commonly used to refer to food breakdown that occurs within animal bodies\",\n\"Decomposers benefit from the increase in nutrient availability\",\n\"Plants and other non-mobile autotrophs cannot travel to seek out nutrients\",\n\"They must rely on decomposers to free up nutrients from dead matter\",\n\"Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings\",\n\"Traditionally, fly agaric was used by different peoples\",\n\"Many species have developed specialized hyphal structures\",\n\"The word mycology is derived from the Greek mykes\",\n\"It denotes the scientific study of fungi\",\n\"These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis\",\n\"A person with immunodeficiency is more susceptible to disease\",\n\"Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin\",\n\"The definition of “decomposer” therefore centers on the outcome of the decomposition process\",\n\"Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems\",\n\"Certain mushrooms are used as supposed therapeutics in folk medicine practices\",\n\"Psilocybin from fungi is investigated for therapeutic use\",\n\"Fungi produce compounds that inhibit viruses and cancer cells\",\n\"A major component is polysaccharide-K\",\n\"Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature\"\n]\n```",
