Williams used lottery tickets as an analogy in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction\",\n\"asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number\",\n\"sexual reproduction was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers\",\n\"Environment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease phenylketonuria\"\n]\n```",
